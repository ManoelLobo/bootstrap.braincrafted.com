    <p>BraincraftedBootstrapBundle should be installed using <a href="http://getcomposer.org">Composer</a>:</p>

    <pre><code class="json">{
    "require": {
        "braincrafted/bootstrap-bundle": "2.0.*"
    }
}</code></pre>

    <p>By default BraincraftedBootstrapBundle <strong>does not include Bootstrap and jQuery</strong>. Some people want to use Composer for these dependencies, other people prefer tools designed for managing assets like Bower. If you want to use such a tool we assume you know how to use it. If you have no experience with these tools you probably want to stick with those from the PHP/Symfony2 world, that is, Composer. You can use the following code in your <code>composer.json</code> to include Bootstrap and jQuery into your Symfony2 project:</p>

    <pre><code class="json">{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "package",
            "package": {
                "name": "jquery/jquery",
                "version": "1.10.2",
                "dist": {
                    "url": "http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.js",
                    "type": "file"
                }
            }
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        ... other dependencies
        "twbs/bootstrap": "3.0.*",
        "jquery/jquery":  "1.10.*"
    }
}
    </code></pre>

    <p>Of course you also need to add the bundle to your <code>AppKernel.php</code>:</p>

    <pre><code class="php"># app/AppKernel.php

class AppKernel extends Kernel
{
    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = array(
            // ...
            new Braincrafted\Bundle\BootstrapBundle\BraincraftedBootstrapBundle(),
        );
        // ...
    }
}

</code></pre>

    <p>BraincraftedBootstrapBundle highly recommends you to use Assetic for managing assets. If you do use Assetic for managing your assets you should now run the <code>dump</code> command.</p>

    <pre><code>php app/console assetic:dump</code></pre>

    <p><span class="label label-info">Please note</span> Assetic needs to compile the LESS files from Bootstrap and therefore requires either <a href="http://lesscss.org">LESS</a> or <a href="http://leafo.net/lessphp/">lessphp</a>. The following section explains how to install and configure them.</p>

    <h3>Installing a LESS compiler</h3>

    <p>As mentioned above you need either LESS or lessphp. Not both.</p>

    <p><span class="label label-primary">Don't forget</span> You have to install the library, configure Assetic to compile <code>.less</code> files using that library and you have to tell BraincraftedBootstrapBundle if you want to use <code>less</code> or <code>lessphp</code>.</p>

    <h4>LESS</h4>

    <p>We highly recommend using the original version of LESS, since the developers of Bootstrap only use this version to compile the stylesheets and it can happen that Bootstrap does not compile with lessphp. To install LESS you need <a href="https://npmjs.org">NPM</a>.</p>

    <pre><code>npm install -g less</code></pre>

    <p>You probably need to configure Assetic to use the installed binary. Please change the path to Node.js where you have installed Node.js on your system.</p>

    <pre><code># app/config/config.yml
assetic:
    filters:
        less:
            node: /usr/local/bin/node
            node_paths: [/usr/local/lib/node_modules]
            apply_to: "\.less$"
        cssrewrite: ~
braincrafted_bootstrap:
    less_filter: less</code></pre>

    <h4>lessphp</h4>

    <p>Although it is not recommended to use lessphp, you can use it and install it via Composer.</p>

    <pre><code class="json">{
  "require": {
    "leafo/lessphp": "0.4.0"
  }
}</code></pre>

    <p>And add the following section to your config.</p>

    <pre><code class="yamnl"># app/config/config.yml
assetic:
    filters:
        lessphp:
             file: %kernel.root_dir%/../vendor/leafo/lessphp/lessc.inc.php
             apply_to: "\.less$"
        cssrewrite: ~
braincrafted_bootstrap:
    less_filter: lessphp</code></pre>

    <p><span class="label label-info">Hint</span> If a new version of Bootstrap no longer compiles with lessphp, check the <a href="http://leafo.net/lessphp/">lessphp website</a> if a new version has been released.</p>

    <h3 id="installing-glyphicons">Installing Glyphicons</h3>

    <p>Bootstrap comes with support for Glyphicons. However, you need to copy the icon fonts into your <code>web/</code> directory, so that browsers can find it. BraincraftedBootstrapBundle comes with a command to copy the files for you</p>

    <pre><code class="bash">php app/console braincrafted:bootstrap:install</code></pre>

    <p>Since you need to do this everytime the font changes in Bootstrap, you can also configure a <code>ScriptHandler</code> in your <code>composer.json</code>. Now the icon fonts are copied into the web directory after Composer updated the packages.</p>

    <pre><code class="json">{
    ...
    "scripts": {
        "post-install-cmd": [
            ...
            "Braincrafted\\Bundle\\BootstrapBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::install"
        ],
        "post-update-cmd": [
            ...
            "Braincrafted\\Bundle\\BootstrapBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::install"
        ]
    }
    ...
}</code></pre>
